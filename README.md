# Hi there, I'm Muyiwa Obamakin 👋

### Computer Science Graduate (1st Class Honours) | Former Scholarship Athlete

I am a First Class Computer Science graduate from the University of Essex, seeking a Graduate Software Engineering or Fintech role.

As a former basketball scholarship athlete turned developer, I've adopted the collaborative mindset required to thrive in dynamic team environments. I specialize in building scalable backend systems, data-driven applications, and applying machine learning theory to practice.
